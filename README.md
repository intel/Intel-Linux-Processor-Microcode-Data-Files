## Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files 

### Why? 

microcode updates are supposed to address:
* Security issues
* Stability issues (voltage/thermal-related)
* Incorrect processor behavior (which could cause unpredictable program behavior, hangs, crashes, reboots, memory corruption, incorrect calculations, etc)
* very rarely, additional functionality

> A potential security vulnerability in CPUs may allow information disclosure.  Intel is releasing Microcode Updates (MCU) updates to mitigate this potential vulnerability.
